## 📌 What is Taxentia?

**Taxentia.ai** is a professional-grade SaaS platform designed to help CPAs and tax professionals answer complex IRS code questions with confidence, speed, and citation-backed clarity.

Unlike generic AI chatbots, Taxentia:

✅ Interprets IRS Code, Treasury Regs, IRS Pubs, Rev. Ruls., and case law  
✅ Builds chain-of-reasoning logic for every response  
✅ Cites exact code sections and references (e.g., IRC §195, Pub. 535)  
✅ Displays confidence scores + fallback logic when guidance is unclear  
✅ Supports client-level query tracking, memo generation, and more
